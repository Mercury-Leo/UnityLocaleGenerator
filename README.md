# Unity Locale Generator

A Unity Editor extension that scans your Localization Tables and generates strongly-typed, static properties for each entry—making it easy and safe to access localized strings in code.

## Overview

**Unity Locale Generator** is an Editor‑only Unity package that watches your String Table Collections and automatically generates a C# class (`LocaleClasses.cs`) containing `LocalizedString` properties for each table entry. No more magic string keys—just `LocaleMyTable.MyKey`!

- ✅ **Auto‑generate** on table edits or via menu
- ✅ **Lazy initialization** for optimal performance
- ✅ **Configurable output folder** via Project Settings
- ✅ **Extension method** to clone `LocalizedString` instances

## Features

- **Static classes per table**  
  Each table collection gets its own `Locale<TableName>` static class.

- **Lazy‑loaded `LocalizedString`**  
  Properties use `Lazy<LocalizedString>` under the hood, so they won’t be created until first accessed.

- **Clone extension**  
  A simple `.Clone()` extension on `LocalizedString` to create safe, mutable copies.
